# Computational text analysis (for design process analysis) 2024

Jupyter Notebooks accompanying the introduction to computational text analysis given as part of the [Exploring Design Intelligence (ID5138)](https://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=66390) at the Industrial Design Engineering Master's Programme at TU Delft.

#### Note:
Notebooks currently have minimal explanation as this is a work in progress and meant to accompany the lecture presentations.

This content is a modification of the 1-day workshop on [Computational Text Analysis](https://github.com/senthilchandrasegaran/computational-text-analysis-2023), which is in turn based on the excellent publicly-available repository on [Computational Text Analysis for Humanists and Social Scientists](https://github.com/lknelson/text-analysis-2017/) by [Dr. Laura K. Nelson](https://www.lauraknelson.com/).
